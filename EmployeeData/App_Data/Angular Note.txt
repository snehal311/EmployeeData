****Angular components overview
$.Components are the main building block for Angular applications. Each component consists of:
$.An HTML template that declares what renders on the page
$.A TypeScript class that defines behavior
$.A CSS selector that defines how the component is used in a template
$.Optionally, CSS styles applied to the template
